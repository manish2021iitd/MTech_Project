This approach provides a solid foundation for building an automated system for generating Gherkin test scripts from ADAS user manuals. To ensure success, here are additional recommendations and actionable steps tailored for each phase:


---

Phase 1: Proof of Concept (POC)

Requirement Extraction Agent

Tools: Start with Python and basic NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy.

Focus: Simple sentence parsing and keyword identification (e.g., "warn the driver", "deviates from lane").

Output: A JSON format like:

{
  "requirement_id": "REQ-001",
  "description": "The system shall warn the driver if the vehicle deviates from its lane.",
  "priority": "High",
  "category": "Lane Keeping Assistance"
}


Gherkin Generation Agent

Example Rules-Based Mapping:

Input: Requirement text.

Output:

Feature: Lane Keeping Assistance
  Scenario: Warn the driver if vehicle deviates from its lane
    Given the vehicle is driving on a marked lane
    When the vehicle deviates from the lane
    Then the system should issue a warning


Testing: Validate with simple examples. Avoid ambiguity.


Missing Test Case Analysis Agent

Goal: Ensure all JSON requirements map to at least one scenario.

Method: Compare requirement_id in the structured data with Gherkin files.


Orchestrator Agent

Implement as a sequential Python script:

def orchestrator():
    requirements = extract_requirements("ADAS_manual.pdf")
    gherkin_files = generate_gherkin(requirements)
    missing_cases = analyze_coverage(requirements, gherkin_files)
    generate_report(requirements, gherkin_files, missing_cases)



---

Phase 2: Expanding Functionality

Requirement Extraction Agent

Advanced NLP Techniques:

Use spaCy or Hugging Face transformers for:

NER: Identify terms like "driver", "vehicle", "warning system".

Dependency Parsing: Handle complex sentence structures.


Include domain-specific vocabularies for ADAS terminology.



Gherkin Generation Agent

Templates and Parameterization:

Build a library of Gherkin templates.

Example: Use parameters for dynamic values.

Scenario Outline: Detect lane deviation
  Given the vehicle is driving at <speed> km/h in a <road_condition> lane
  When the vehicle <action>
  Then the system should issue a <type_of_warning>

Examples:
  | speed | road_condition | action       | type_of_warning |
  | 80    | marked         | deviates     | visual alert    |
  | 60    | unmarked       | drifts       | auditory alert  |



Missing Test Case Analysis Agent

Semantic Similarity:

Use models like BERT to compare requirement text and Gherkin scenarios.

Example:

Requirement: "Warn the driver if the car exceeds the speed limit."

Scenario:

Given the car is on a road with a speed limit of 60 km/h  
When the car exceeds the speed limit  
Then the system should alert the driver




Traceability Report Generation Agent

Generate matrix linking:

Requirement IDs â†’ Gherkin Scenarios.

Include missing scenarios flagged by the analysis.

Format: CSV/HTML.




---

Phase 3: Advanced Features and Refinement

Machine Learning for Gherkin Generation

Approach:

Train a sequence-to-sequence model (e.g., T5 or GPT) on pairs of requirements and their Gherkin scenarios.

Fine-tune using a dataset of ADAS-specific requirements and test cases.



Agent Communication and Coordination

Use CrewAI or an open-source multi-agent framework.

Enable agents to send structured messages (e.g., JSON payloads).



Integration with Testing Tools

Automate Gherkin script execution with Behave or Cucumber:

Use Behave to validate scenarios and produce test results.




---

Key Metrics for Evaluation

Requirement Extraction:

Precision: Fraction of correctly identified requirements.

Recall: Fraction of total requirements extracted.


Gherkin Generation:

Coverage: % of requirements mapped to valid Gherkin scenarios.

Readability: Manual review of generated scenarios for clarity and completeness.


System Efficiency:

Time taken to process one page of a manual.

Scalability with larger datasets.




---

Challenges and Solutions

Ambiguity in Manuals:

Use domain-specific NLP models fine-tuned on ADAS manuals.


Complex Requirements:

Break down long, compound sentences into simpler clauses during preprocessing.


Coverage Gaps:

Iteratively refine rules/templates and use feedback loops to improve.

This approach ensures that you can start small, deliver tangible results, and gradually enhance the system's capabilities through iterative development and advanced techniques. Let me know if you'd like detailed code snippets or assistance with specific components!

Executing such a project involves implementing individual components step by step. I'll begin by focusing on the Requirement Extraction Agent for extracting structured requirements from an example ADAS user manual text.

Steps:

1. Define a sample requirement from an ADAS manual.


2. Use Python and NLP techniques to parse and extract structured data.


3. Output the data in JSON format.



Let's implement this.
To use the CrewAI framework for implementing a multi-agent system to process ADAS user manuals, we'll design agents for specific tasks and manage them with an orchestrator. Here's how to set up the Requirement Extraction Agent using CrewAI.


---

Steps to Implement Using CrewAI

1. Install CrewAI Framework
If you haven't installed CrewAI, do so using pip:

pip install crewai


2. Define Agents

Requirement Extraction Agent: Processes text and extracts requirements.

Additional agents for Gherkin generation, missing test case analysis, and traceability can be added later.



3. Orchestrator
Coordinates the interaction between agents.


4. Implement Basic Functionality
Start with the Requirement Extraction Agent.

Code Implementation: Requirement Extraction Using CrewAI

from crewai import Agent, Orchestrator

# Define the Requirement Extraction Agent
class RequirementExtractionAgent(Agent):
    def process(self, text):
        keywords = ["system shall", "issue", "warn", "adjust"]
        requirements = []
        for i, line in enumerate(text.splitlines()):
            if any(keyword in line.lower() for keyword in keywords):
                requirements.append({
                    "requirement_id": f"REQ-{i+1:03}",
                    "description": line.strip(),
                    "priority": "High",  # Placeholder
                    "category": "ADAS Functionality"  # Placeholder
                })
        return requirements


# Define the Orchestrator
class ADASOrchestrator(Orchestrator):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.add_agent("requirement_extractor", RequirementExtractionAgent())

    def run(self, text):
        # Pass the text to the Requirement Extraction Agent
        extraction_results = self.agents["requirement_extractor"].process(text)
        return extraction_results


# Example ADAS user manual text
adas_manual_text = """
The system shall warn the driver if the vehicle deviates from its lane.
If the vehicle's speed exceeds 80 km/h, the system shall issue an auditory warning.
The system shall automatically adjust the vehicle's speed to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead.
"""

# Run the orchestrator
orchestrator = ADASOrchestrator()
extracted_requirements = orchestrator.run(adas_manual_text)

# Print the results
for req in extracted_requirements:
    print(req)


---

Output Example

For the given text, the output might look like:

[
  {
    "requirement_id": "REQ-001",
    "description": "The system shall warn the driver if the vehicle deviates from its lane.",
    "priority": "High",
    "category": "ADAS Functionality"
  },
  {
    "requirement_id": "REQ-002",
    "description": "If the vehicle's speed exceeds 80 km/h, the system shall issue an auditory warning.",
    "priority": "High",
    "category": "ADAS Functionality"
  },
  {
    "requirement_id": "REQ-003",
    "description": "The system shall automatically adjust the vehicle's speed to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead.",
    "priority": "High",
    "category": "ADAS Functionality"
  }
]


---

Next Steps

Add a Gherkin Generation Agent to translate extracted requirements into Gherkin scenarios.

Expand the orchestrator to include these agents and ensure smooth data flow between them.

Integrate missing test case analysis and traceability reporting agents.


Would you like to proceed with implementing the next agent?

The next step is to implement the Gherkin Generation Agent, which will translate the structured requirements extracted by the Requirement Extraction Agent into Gherkin feature files. Here's how to proceed:


---

Steps for Implementing Gherkin Generation Agent

1. Define the Gherkin Syntax Rules
Use the Given, When, Then structure to create scenarios based on extracted requirements.


2. Agent Workflow

Accept structured requirements (JSON format) from the Requirement Extraction Agent.

Use predefined templates or rules to generate Gherkin feature files.



3. Orchestrator Integration
Add the Gherkin Generation Agent to the orchestrator and pass the extracted requirements to it.

Next Steps

Improve traceability reporting formats (e.g., HTML, integrated with a test management tool like Jira).

Integrate the generated Gherkin scenarios into testing frameworks like Behave for automation.

Perform validation and testing on larger, real-world ADAS manuals.


Would you like to proceed with HTML report generation or test framework integration?
The next step is to integrate the generated Gherkin scenarios into a testing framework like Behave to enable automated execution of the test cases. This step ensures that the scenarios are not just created but also actionable for testing.


---

Steps for Test Framework Integration

1. Prerequisites

Install Behave:

pip install behave

Ensure that your environment is set up for automated test execution (e.g., Python, required libraries, and dependencies).



2. File Structure for Behave
Behave uses a specific directory structure. Prepare the following:

/features
â”œâ”€â”€ steps/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ step_definitions.py  # Contains Python code for step definitions
â””â”€â”€ test_scenarios.feature   # Contains Gherkin scenarios


3. Steps

Save generated Gherkin scenarios to .feature files.

Write step definitions in Python to link Gherkin steps to test logic.

Execute the scenarios using Behave.





---

Code Implementation

1. Save Gherkin Scenarios to .feature File

class GherkinGenerationAgent(Agent):
    def save_to_feature_file(self, gherkin_scenarios, file_path="features/test_scenarios.feature"):
        with open(file_path, "w") as file:
            file.write("\n".join(gherkin_scenarios))
        print(f"Gherkin scenarios saved to {file_path}")

2. Step Definitions for Behave

Create a Python file for step definitions (e.g., features/steps/step_definitions.py).

from behave import given, when, then

@given('the vehicle is operating normally')
def step_given_vehicle_normal(context):
    print("Vehicle is in a normal state.")

@when('the system shall warn the driver if the vehicle deviates from its lane')
def step_when_vehicle_deviates(context):
    print("Vehicle deviates from the lane.")

@then('the system shall warn the driver')
def step_then_warn_driver(context):
    print("Driver warning issued.")

@when('the vehicle\'s speed exceeds 80 km/h')
def step_when_speed_exceeds(context):
    print("Speed exceeds 80 km/h.")

@then('the system shall issue an auditory warning')
def step_then_auditory_warning(context):
    print("Auditory warning issued.")

3. Run the Tests

Use Behave to execute the tests:

behave

Update the Orchestrator

Enhance the orchestrator to save Gherkin scenarios to .feature files automatically.

class ADASOrchestrator(Orchestrator):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.add_agent("requirement_extractor", RequirementExtractionAgent())
        self.add_agent("gherkin_generator", GherkinGenerationAgent())
        self.add_agent("test_case_analyzer", MissingTestCaseAnalysisAgent())
        self.add_agent("traceability_reporter", TraceabilityReportAgent())

    def run(self, text):
        # Step 1: Extract requirements
        extraction_results = self.agents["requirement_extractor"].process(text)
        # Step 2: Generate Gherkin scenarios
        gherkin_scenarios = self.agents["gherkin_generator"].process(extraction_results)
        # Save scenarios to .feature file
        self.agents["gherkin_generator"].save_to_feature_file(gherkin_scenarios)
        # Step 3: Analyze missing test cases
        missing_cases = self.agents["test_case_analyzer"].process(extraction_results, gherkin_scenarios)
        # Step 4: Generate traceability report
        traceability_matrix = self.agents["traceability_reporter"].process(
            extraction_results, gherkin_scenarios, missing_cases
        )
        self.agents["traceability_reporter"].export_to_csv(traceability_matrix)
        return extraction_results, gherkin_scenarios, missing_cases, traceability_matrix


---

Run the Orchestrator

# Example ADAS manual text
adas_manual_text = """
The system shall warn the driver if the vehicle deviates from its lane.
If the vehicle's speed exceeds 80 km/h, the system shall issue an auditory warning.
"""

# Execute the orchestrator
orchestrator = ADASOrchestrator()
(
    extracted_requirements,
    generated_scenarios,
    missing_cases,
    traceability_matrix
) = orchestrator.run(adas_manual_text)

# Gherkin scenarios are now saved and ready for Behave test execution


---

Next Steps

1. Validate Tests

Execute the Behave tests to verify that all steps are implemented correctly.



2. Handle Test Failures

Improve step definitions to connect to real systems or mock data for better test accuracy.



3. Enhance Coverage

Add more robust step definitions and parameterized scenarios for broader test coverage.




Would you like to proceed with parameterizing the Gherkin scenarios or integrating with a CI/CD pipeline?
The next step is to parameterize the Gherkin scenarios and integrate the test execution into a CI/CD pipeline. This will make the system more flexible, scalable, and suitable for automated testing in real-world workflows.


---

Steps for Parameterization and CI/CD Integration

1. Parameterize Gherkin Scenarios

Parameterization allows the same Gherkin scenario to be executed with multiple input values, reducing duplication and increasing flexibility.

Example: Parameterizing Scenarios

Original Gherkin Scenario:

Scenario: Speed warning
  Given the vehicle's speed is 85 km/h
  When the system checks the speed
  Then the system shall issue an auditory warning

Parameterized Gherkin Scenario:

Scenario Outline: Speed warning
  Given the vehicle's speed is <speed> km/h
  When the system checks the speed
  Then the system shall issue an auditory warning

  Examples:
    | speed |
    | 85    |
    | 90    |
    | 95    |

Implementation:

Modify the GherkinGenerationAgent to include parameterization logic.

class GherkinGenerationAgent(Agent):
    def process(self, requirements):
        scenarios = []
        for req in requirements:
            if "speed" in req["description"]:
                scenarios.append(
                    """Scenario Outline: Speed warning
  Given the vehicle's speed is <speed> km/h
  When the system checks the speed
  Then the system shall issue an auditory warning

  Examples:
    | speed |
    | 85    |
    | 90    |
    | 95    |
"""
                )
            else:
                scenarios.append(f"""Scenario: {req['description']}
  Given the system is operational
  When {req['description']}
  Then appropriate action should occur
""")
        return scenarios

2. Update Step Definitions

Update the Behave step definitions to handle parameterized inputs.

from behave import given, when, then

@given("the vehicle's speed is {speed:d} km/h")
def step_given_vehicle_speed(context, speed):
    context.speed = speed
    print(f"Vehicle speed set to {speed} km/h")

@when("the system checks the speed")
def step_when_system_checks_speed(context):
    print(f"System checks speed: {context.speed} km/h")

@then("the system shall issue an auditory warning")
def step_then_auditory_warning(context):
    if context.speed > 80:
        print("Auditory warning issued!")
    else:
        print("No warning needed.")


---

3. CI/CD Pipeline Integration

Tools to Use:

CI/CD Platforms: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI.

Test Execution Framework: Behave.

Reporting Tools: Allure, HTML reports, or built-in CI/CD features.


Example: GitHub Actions Configuration

1. Create a .github/workflows/test.yml file:

name: Run BDD Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: "3.9"

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install behave

    - name: Run Tests
      run: |
        behave


2. Push the workflow file to the repository.


3. Each time code is pushed or a pull request is created, the pipeline will:

Install dependencies.

Run Behave tests.

Provide test results in the Actions tab.





---

4. Enhance Reporting

Use reporting tools to generate detailed test execution reports.

Allure Integration:

1. Install Allure Behave adapter:

pip install allure-behave


2. Update the GitHub Actions workflow to generate and upload reports:

- name: Run Tests with Allure
  run: |
    behave -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o allure-results
- name: Upload Allure Report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: allure-report
    path: allure-results




---

Next Steps

1. Run Parameterized Tests

Verify that parameterized scenarios execute correctly.

Test with real-world ADAS examples to ensure accuracy.



2. Integrate Test Results with Project Management Tools

Link test results to Jira or TestRail for enhanced traceability.



3. Scale the System

Add more scenarios and coverage for different ADAS features.

Optimize the pipeline for faster test execution.




Would you like to proceed with setting up enhanced reporting or linking test results to a project management tool like Jira?
The next step is to link test results with a project management tool like Jira or TestRail for better traceability and collaboration. This integration helps stakeholders track test coverage, execution status, and identified issues directly from their project management dashboard.


---

Steps for Jira/TestRail Integration

1. Integrating Test Results with Jira

Jira can track test results as part of its project management features. You can link Behave test execution results to Jira using plugins like Xray or custom API scripts.

A. Use Xray for Jira Integration

1. Install Xray Plugin in Jira

Ensure your Jira instance has the Xray plugin installed.

Xray enables test case management, linking test cases to requirements, and reporting on test execution.



2. Generate Test Execution Reports

Export test results from Behave in a format Xray can consume, such as JUnit XML:

behave -f junit -o reports

This will create a reports/junit.xml file containing the test execution details.



3. Upload Test Results to Xray

Use Xray's REST API to upload the test results.

Example Python script to upload results:

import requests

jira_url = "https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net"
xray_api_endpoint = f"{jira_url}/rest/raven/1.0/import/execution/junit"
auth = ("your-email@example.com", "your-api-token")

with open("reports/junit.xml", "rb") as file:
    response = requests.post(xray_api_endpoint, auth=auth, files={"file": file})

print(f"Response: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")



4. View Test Results in Jira

Once uploaded, test results will appear in Xray as part of the test execution report, linked to the related requirements.





---

B. Direct Integration via Jira API

1. Create a "Test Case" issue type in Jira.


2. Use the Jira REST API to programmatically create issues for each Gherkin scenario.

Example Python script:

import requests
import json

jira_url = "https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net"
auth = ("your-email@example.com", "your-api-token")

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

# Create a new test case in Jira
def create_test_case(summary, description):
    payload = {
        "fields": {
            "project": {"key": "PROJECT_KEY"},
            "summary": summary,
            "description": description,
            "issuetype": {"name": "Test Case"}
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(
        f"{jira_url}/rest/api/2/issue", auth=auth, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload)
    )

    print(f"Response: {response.status_code} - {response.json()}")

# Example test cases
test_cases = [
    {"summary": "Test Lane Departure Warning", "description": "Verify system warns on lane departure."},
    {"summary": "Test Speed Warning", "description": "Verify auditory warning for speed > 80 km/h."}
]

for test in test_cases:
    create_test_case(test["summary"], test["description"])





---

2. Integrating Test Results with TestRail

TestRail is another popular tool for test management. Integration involves uploading test cases and execution results.

1. Install TestRail Python API Client

pip install testrail-api


2. Upload Test Results Example Python script to upload results:

from testrail_api import TestRailAPI

# Connect to TestRail
api = TestRailAPI("https://your-testrail-instance.testrail.io", "your-email@example.com", "your-api-token")

# Create a test run
run = api.runs.add_run(
    project_id=1, name="ADAS Gherkin Test Run", description="Test run for ADAS scenarios"
)

# Upload test results
results = [
    {"case_id": 1, "status_id": 1, "comment": "Passed"},
    {"case_id": 2, "status_id": 5, "comment": "Failed"}
]

for result in results:
    api.results.add_result_for_case(run["id"], result["case_id"], result)




---

Update the Orchestrator

Add functionality to push results to Jira or TestRail after test execution.

class ADASOrchestrator(Orchestrator):
    def run(self, text):
        # Extract requirements
        extraction_results = self.agents["requirement_extractor"].process(text)
        # Generate Gherkin scenarios
        gherkin_scenarios = self.agents["gherkin_generator"].process(extraction_results)
        self.agents["gherkin_generator"].save_to_feature_file(gherkin_scenarios)
        # Execute tests
        print("Running Behave tests...")
        os.system("behave -f junit -o reports")
        # Push results to Jira or TestRail
        self.push_results_to_jira_or_testrail("reports/junit.xml")

    def push_results_to_jira_or_testrail(self, report_path):
        # Placeholder for Jira or TestRail API integration
        print(f"Pushing test results to project management tool from {report_path}")


---

Next Steps

1. Validate Jira/TestRail Integration

Ensure test cases and execution results appear correctly.



2. Automate Result Upload in CI/CD

Add result upload to your CI/CD pipeline after test execution.



3. Enhance Traceability

Link test cases to specific requirements in Jira/TestRail for end-to-end traceability.




Would you like assistance with automating the result upload in CI/CD or linking specific test cases to requirements?
The next steps involve further scaling and optimizing the system to ensure robustness, traceability, and usability in real-world testing scenarios. Here's how you can proceed:


---

1. Automate Result Upload in CI/CD

Integrate the process of uploading test results to Jira/TestRail as part of your CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that results are automatically updated in your project management tools with every pipeline run.

Steps:

1. Extend the CI/CD Workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions):

Add steps to execute the result upload script after running Behave tests.


Example GitHub Actions Workflow:

- name: Upload Test Results to Jira
  run: python upload_to_jira.py

- name: Upload Test Results to TestRail
  run: python upload_to_testrail.py


2. Ensure API Tokens are Secure:

Store API keys and credentials in CI/CD secrets (e.g., GitHub Secrets, Jenkins Credentials Store).





---

2. Enhance Traceability

Improve traceability between requirements, Gherkin scenarios, and test results. This can be achieved by systematically linking artifacts.

Steps:

1. Map Requirements to Gherkin Scenarios:

Add metadata (e.g., requirement IDs) in Gherkin files to explicitly link scenarios to requirements.


Example:

@REQ-001
Scenario: Lane departure warning
  Given the vehicle is in a marked lane
  When the vehicle deviates from the lane
  Then the system should issue a warning


2. Update Traceability Report:

Enhance the Traceability Report Generation Agent to include these mappings.


Example JSON:

{
  "requirement_id": "REQ-001",
  "gherkin_scenario": "Lane departure warning",
  "test_result": "Passed"
}




---

3. Incorporate Feedback Loops

Leverage feedback from missing test cases, failed test executions, or uncovered requirements to iteratively improve test coverage and scenario generation.

Steps:

1. Review Missing Test Cases:

Use the Missing Test Case Analysis Agent to identify gaps.

Feed these gaps back into the Gherkin Generation Agent for new scenario generation.



2. Handle Complex Requirements:

Introduce hierarchical or nested scenarios for complex requirements.

For example, a parent scenario may define a "happy path," while child scenarios cover edge cases.





---

4. Add Multi-Agent Coordination

Scale the multi-agent system by introducing parallelism and fault tolerance for handling large and complex user manuals.

Steps:

1. Parallel Processing:

Allow agents to process different sections of the ADAS manual concurrently.

Use queues or a task manager like Celery for agent communication.



2. Failure Handling:

Implement retry mechanisms for agents that fail due to issues like ambiguous text or API errors.





---

5. Expand NLP Capabilities

Improve the Requirement Extraction Agent with advanced NLP techniques for better accuracy and understanding of ambiguous or complex text.

Steps:

1. Fine-Tune Language Models:

Train transformers (e.g., Hugging Face models) on a dataset of ADAS-specific text to improve domain-specific understanding.



2. Handle Ambiguity:

Incorporate coreference resolution and context-aware parsing to address ambiguous sentences.





---

6. Scale to Additional ADAS Features

Expand the system to handle more ADAS functionalities (e.g., adaptive cruise control, emergency braking).

Steps:

1. Expand Training Data:

Gather user manuals or technical documentation covering additional ADAS features.



2. Test New Features:

Verify the accuracy and coverage of generated test scenarios for new features.





---

7. Introduce Automated Regression Testing

Set up automated regression testing to validate that new features or changes do not break existing functionality.

Steps:

1. Baseline Test Scenarios:

Maintain a baseline of Gherkin scenarios for core ADAS features.



2. CI/CD Integration:

Run baseline tests as part of every pipeline to catch regressions early.





---

8. Build a User Interface (Optional)

Develop a user-friendly dashboard for stakeholders to interact with the system.

Features:

1. Upload Manuals:

Allow users to upload ADAS user manuals via the UI.



2. View Traceability Reports:

Display reports linking requirements, test cases, and results.



3. Trigger Test Runs:

Provide controls to manually trigger test runs or updates.





---

Key Deliverables for This Phase

1. Automated result upload in CI/CD.


2. Enhanced traceability report with direct links to requirements and test results.


3. Improved multi-agent coordination for large-scale processing.


4. Expanded ADAS feature support.


5. Optional user interface for system interaction.



Would you like to focus on enhancing traceability, adding more ADAS features, or building the UI next?
