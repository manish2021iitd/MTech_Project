Abstract

The verification and validation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) require robust and comprehensive testing methodologies to ensure reliability and safety in real-world driving scenarios. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) has emerged as a promising approach for scenario-based verification, enabling a structured and human-readable test specification process. However, manual development of BDD artifacts, including feature files and step definitions, remains time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Agent System (MAS) approach integrated with Generative AI to automate the BDD process for ADAS scenario-based verification. The framework consists of specialized agents responsible for requirement analysis, feature generation, scenario formulation, test case generation, and quality assurance.

We implement our approach using CrewAI to coordinate these agents, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated script generation. The proposed system ensures exhaustive scenario coverage by dynamically generating missing test cases and maintaining proper mapping between feature files and step definitions. Our implementation demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency, consistency, and scalability compared to manual BDD practices. Experimental results highlight enhanced test coverage and automation efficiency, validating the potential of AI-driven BDD for ADAS verification.

Future work includes integrating the framework with real-world test environments, incorporating Explainable AI (XAI) for transparency, and enhancing cybersecurity measures to ensure robustness. By advancing automated scenario-based verification, our approach contributes to safer and more reliable ADAS development.
